Greenhouse provides a recruiting software as a service. Greenhouse sells annual
 licenses to companies, allowing them to use Greenhouse's software. Greenhouse collects
  into one dashboard the job seekers' applications from different routes like employment
   websites and referrals. Greenhouse is an open platform that uses an application
    programming interface (API) to facilitate the aggregation. To determine which job
     posts are more effective, it allows companies to do A/B testing. Greenhouse lets
      companies create a uniform interview procedure so candidates can be judged based on
       the same rubric. It aggregates a candidate's resumes and interview feedback for
        comparison with the job opening's specifications. It allows companies to
         compare candidates against each other and to compare their hiring metrics
          against the industry standards. (From Wikipedia)
